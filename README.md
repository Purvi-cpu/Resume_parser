<h1>Description of existing system</h1>
Recruiters manually review each submitted resume, extracting important information by reading documents individually.<br>
<h3> Key Characteristics of the Existing System:</h3><br>
<b>Manual Review:</b> Each resume must be opened and read in detail, requiring significant recruiter time and attention.<br>
<b> Unstructured Data:</b> Resumes come in different formats and layouts, making it hard to quickly locate specific information.<br>
<b>Limited Automation:</b> Even on digital platforms, there is little to no automation in extracting or organizing resume content.<br>
<b>Lack of Centralization: </b>Information from resumes is often not integrated into a centralized database, leading to fragmented candidate profiles.<br>
<b>No Real-Time Parsing:</b> Existing systems do not process resumes in real time, delaying candidate evaluation.<br>
